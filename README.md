## Contents and Branches Naming Strategy

This project has a naming strategy for its different elements to facilitate and unify the work between its Collaborators. These conventions are presented below.

### Branches

Branches were created for different category main components and have been cleaned up.
The category word tries to be descriptive and define the content of the branch: **Playlist** , **UITheme**, **MusicPlayer**.
By this rule this is a real case of the Branch name that you can find in this same project: _origin/MusicPlayer_.

### Structural elements

Structural element names have a strict policy to be simple, clear and descriptive. This element includes React components and pages as well as all the main elements of Servers, and normally have to be written with **camelCase** convention. The exception to this are React components, who are written using **PascalCase** convention.

### Style elements

Style elements, that includes all _scss_ files and _classes_ have the same rules: lowercase. The names need to be **descriptive** but **short**.
